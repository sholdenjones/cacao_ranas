AL-N,N,Aubrentino Loor,0647989,0039756,0.359587,-79.670154,"4 from JZJ CCN are parallel going downhill, start of each is by camino. 4 from AL Nacional are perpindicular to slope, start is on CCN side as there wasn't space in the Nacional",1
AZ-C,C,Augustin Zambrano,0650074,0038670,0.349762,-79.651423,"Great site! Nacional and CCN right across from each other with quebrada in between. Dense cover for Nacional, CCN is wide open.",4

DB-C,C,Don Barre,0651058,0043139,0.390182,-79.642576,4th transect is up against forest border down the hill. Start is closest to road. Transects run parallel to forest border ie across hll side although it's not super steep.,15
DB-N,N,Don Barre,0651248,0043016,0.389069,-79.64087,Steep slope w/ pasto separating it from Don Barre's CCN. Transects run up slope to try to take advantage of spatial arrangement of Nacional. Transect 1 is close to border with mixto but we're all good!,15
DG-B,B,Adrian Gavilanes,0646833,0038758,0.350562,-79.680542,"Follow trail from car park downhill, right near Tsalak. 1st transect is next to estero. Had to adjust angles at beginning and end due to some really messy parts.",6
DG-C,C,Adrian Gavilanes,0646747,0038633,0.349432,-79.681315,"Above parking spot, just below football field. Little brook runs through the middle. Transect 1 is closer to the parking lot, 4 is right up against the football field",6
DG-N,N,Adrian Gavilanes,0647061,0038657,0.349648,-79.678493,"Down past river, transects run perpendicular to river. Transect 4 starts above a pretty steep cliff. The 1st transect is to the right facing the tsalak which is mixed in amongst the cacao",6
DG-V,V,Adrian Gavilanes,0645867,0039169,0.354281,-79.68922,Running parallel to road. #1 is closest to road. Starts are right up against barbed wire / pasto. Should be easy to find. For bosque probably use closer to Gavilan's house.,5
FCAT-B1,B,FCAT,0648336,0040738,0.368469,-79.667035,"Walk down trail sendero niño about 3 minutes. Crosses lil quebrada and trasects are in flattish area, 1st is the 1st one you'll cross. Bit of a gap between 2nd and 3rd ones b/c of gnarly bit towards the end.",13
FCAT-B2,B,FCAT,0648291,0041433,0.374755,-79.667439,Good flat spot. Transects run perpindicular to camino. 1st is to the right looking from the camino.,9
FCAT-B3,B,FCAT,0649807,0039901,0.360897,-79.65382,"In a small basin behind where Darwin cut the stakes from the caña. A bit steep on the edges with an estero in the middle. Will likely be slippery after rain. Pay attention to starts as they're not all in a line, had to adjust them a bit to compensate for the hill. We cut a path down from the road donde dejamos la moto. Hope there's cool frogs here!",12
FCAT-V1,V,FCAT,0648232,0040830,0.369301,-79.66797,1st transect is the 1st one we pass. Off Sendero Juan Guillermo.,13

FLL-C,C,FLL,0650436,0043310,0.391729,-79.648165,"Site is a bit past laguna entrance in front of FLL casa. Transects run uphill, moderately steep, perpindicular to road. 1st transect is 1st one you pass, parallel and close to camino up to casa.",14

JS-N,N,Jose Soli,0650595,0043209,0.390816,-79.646736,Right next to entrada la laguna. Inicio is by road with ends going up to the edge of cacao against the laguna. Inicios may seem oddly spaced by b/c we tried to have ends be right at edge of cacao by laguna.,14
JZ-C,C,Jacinto Zambrano,0648068,0042206,0.381747,-79.669441,"Both sites opposite sides of estero. 1 for each is closest to Estero. Nacional is tough to walk through, may be difficult to find transects at times",8

LG-C,C,Luis Gonzalez,0649603,0038609,0.349211,-79.655655,"CCN is right on side of camino. Was hard to find a spot with pure CCN, but this was the closest. About 5-10 Nacional trees mixed in but definitely a CCN spot. Transects run perpindicular to camino. 1 is lowest, closest towards house.",3
LG-N,N,Luis Gonzalez,0649687,0038580,0.348948,-79.6549,"Nacional is by the bamboo down a ways from the camino a la casa. There's a steep creek bed running between the Nacional sites, 2 transects on each side. Transect 1 is closest to camino, 1st one you cross going down.",3
